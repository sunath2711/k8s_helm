# Kubernetes Python Platform Project

## Overview
This project is a production-style reference platform demonstrating how Python-based
applications are containerized and deployed on Kubernetes using Docker and Helm.

It showcases real-world Kubernetes concepts including:
- Stateless and stateful workloads
- Configuration and secret management
- Scheduling and scaling strategies
- Helm-based application packaging

## Tech Stack
- Python (FastAPI)
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- PostgreSQL

## Project Structure
- `app/` – Application source code
- `docker/` – Dockerfiles
- `k8s/raw-manifests/` – Plain Kubernetes YAMLs (learning phase)
- `k8s/helm/` – Helm charts (production packaging)
- `docs/` – Architecture and design decisions

## Status
🚧 Phase 0 – Repository setup and environment preparation
